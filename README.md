# DS-Practicum-2

The code in this project analyzes data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Wildlife Strike Database, which contains information about bird strikes to civil aircraft in the United States from 1990 to 2024. The goal of the analysis is to explore trends and patterns in bird strikes, perform statistical tests, and create predictive models based on the dataset. The Python technical features used in the code include the Pandas library for data manipulation and cleaning, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and SciPy for performing statistical tests such as t-tests and correlation analysis. The code also utilizes Scikit-learn for building a simple linear regression model to predict future bird strike occurrences. Data preparation techniques such as handling missing values, converting data types, and generating summary statistics are applied to ensure the dataset is suitable for analysis. The analysis includes generating visualizations to explore distributions, relationships between variables, and temporal trends over the years. Additionally, hypothesis testing and statistical modeling are performed to evaluate significant patterns and predict future incidents.
